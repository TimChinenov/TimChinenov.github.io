	<h1>Bxbx</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Bxbx is a simple java based game that I am currently developing. The game follows the unlikely hero Bxbx, a blue box with a small body and big dreams. You follow Bxbx as he moves forward and help him avoid obstacles and collect tokens. I am a single developer in this game and am always looking for more help!</p>
	<h3>Programming Development</h3>
	<p>With this game, it was my goal to learn about how to use Java as I am more familiar with Python and C++. I have made several iterations of the code in order to optomize the preformance of the game. My first iteration of the game was done completely using a single class. The game ended up having difficulties loading certain assests. I am now working on reformating the game into appropriatly.</p>
	<h3>Art Development</h3>
	<p>I am definetly not an artist, but I have put my best foot forward for developing this game. I have transitioned from making assets from simple mspaint to more complicated, but beautiful, corelDraw. Below are some of the 2D assests I've made for the game.</p>
