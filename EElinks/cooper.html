		<h1><strong>Cooper Union 2012 Electrical Engineering Summer Internship</strong></h1><br>

		<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><br>
		While exploring fields of interest, I participated in the Cooper Union 2012 Summer Internship. The internship aimed at exploring electrical engineering with high school students who were new to the field. The internship aimed to teach us the basics of circuitry, CAD design and robotics programming. Along with the technical material, the internship introduced me to group engineering. We were organized in groups of three and we were responsible for presenting our weekly progress through PowerPoint presentation to the professor leading the course.<br><br>

		The task for the internship was to build a sumo-robot. These robots had two objectives; To stay inside the arena that they were placed in and to push out the enemy robots. There were dimension and material limitations imposed and a requirement for certain electronics to be used. The rest of the robots design was up to the team.

		<h3><strong>Design</strong></h3><br>

		Our team's initial and standing idea was to create a robot that would be able to push its opponents out by lifting the opponent. In doing so, the opposing robot would have no traction with the ground. The team started by going for a forklift design, which was quickly scrapped due to the complicated design that would be required. Instead we went with a ramp that would be placed close to the floor. In order to win in pushing battles, we incorporated a gear train connecting the motor to the wheel. <br><br>

In order to win in pushing battles, we incorporated a gear train connecting the motor to the wheel. This gear train was the most unique aspect of our robot, as other team robot's connected the wheel directly to the motor. The rest of the robot was made to be bulky and heavy. We maximized the dimensions that were given to us.<br><br>

		<h3><strong>Fabrication</strong></h3>
		The parts for the robot were designed in the Solid Works CAD program and cut out on plastic sheets using a laser cutter. The sheets were assembled using glue. We made a last second decision to use a flexible sheet of thin plastic for the ramp instead of planks of thick plastic. We went with a white ramp in order to throw off other robots that turned around if they detected white, as this was the color of the border. This allowed us to have a much wider ramp than we previously planned. The ramp was connected to the ramp supports using duct tape (the best adhesive). The circuitry of the board was designed by one of my peers while I coded the microcontroller for the robot. The commands for the robot were very straight forward. We programmed the robot such that if the robot found white, which was the color of the border, it would turn 180 degrees and go forward. <br><br>

		<h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>
		Our idea of using a gear train to increase the torque of the robot did work out. Using a smaller gear to larger gear ratio slowed the robot but let it win any tug of war. Our robot was able to make to second place among the other teams robots before losing. Due to rushing the final assembly we did not secure our circuit board well enough. One of the wires in the board got loose and jammed one of our gear trains. <br><br>
