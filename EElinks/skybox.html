		<h1><strong>Skybox: The Ultimate Cloud Based Storage System</strong></h1>
		<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
		<p>In 2016, as part of RPI's engineering design course, I worked with a group of engineers to develop
		the Skybox. The purpose of the device was to save floor space in cramped apartments such as those in NYC.
		The initial solution to this problem was a device that is positioned high above the floor that 
		could transport items from a high position to a lower position, essentially clearing ground clutter. After
		interviewing different potential customers, the group found that there was a demand for such a device specifically for 
		important documents and small valuables. The envisioned solution was the Skybox. The Skybox was designed to be a full automated storage system that could hold small items in higher places.</p>

		<h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>
		<p>The Skybox was originally designed and 3D modeled using Nx 9.0; a CAD modeling program. Certain mechanical features were simulated in the program, such as the motion of the servo that was reponsible for pushing the Skybox out of the main frame. </p>

	<h3><strong>Fabrication</strong></h3>
	<p>To fabricate the Skybox, the CAD models were used to laser cut the required shapes out of Micro Density Fiber board. The team assembled the Skybox using normal wood glue to hold the duck tailings. The arms used for the horizontal motion of the skybox were machined from .25in acrylic plastic.</p>

		<p>The electronics for the Skybox were centered around the Arduino. The Arduino was programmed to interface with the control panel, arm servo, and stepper motors of the 
		Skybox. The circuit for distributing power and the control panel were designed using
		upverter and implememnted on bread board before finally moving onto perfboard. </p>
